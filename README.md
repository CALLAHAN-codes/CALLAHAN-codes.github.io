A Website full of websites<br>

This open source repository is a way for me to publish small projects that might inspire people to create their own website and/or share their own code. It will also help inspire me to create and code more. Each project file will be filled with comments explaining each line/section of code to help people understand what's going on. Check the console while each site loads or each function call and you should see the process happening live.
